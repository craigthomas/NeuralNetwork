# Neural Network 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/craigthomas/NeuralNetwork.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/craigthomas/NeuralNetwork) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/craigthomas/NeuralNetwork/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/craigthomas/NeuralNetwork?branch=master)


## What is it?

This project implements a general purpose Neural Network. This particular
implementation is used specifically for image recognition, however, it 
can be applied to many other machine learning problems. 

In the context of image recognition, the Neural Network was originally
built to determine if a deer (or other wildlife) is in a photo. To make 
it work, you must first `train` the network to recognize deer or other objects. Once
trained, you can then feed the neural network other photos, and it will 
attempt to find instances of the objects it knows about within those 
photos.

For more information on the Deer Detector goal, [read my blog posts on the
project](http://craigthomas.ca/blog/2014/08/04/deer-detection-with-machine-learning-part-1/)

Note: some code has recently moved around. The code to take pictures with a Kinect
still exists, but has moved to a [new GitHub repo](https://github.com/craigthomas/KinectTimeLapse).
To take pictures with a Raspberry Pi NOIR camera, see my [other GitHub repo](https://github.com/craigthomas/RPiDayNightCamera).


## License

This project makes use of an MIT style license. Please see the file called 
LICENSE for more information. Note that this project may make use of other
software that has separate license terms. See the section called `Third
Party Licenses and Attributions` below for more information on those
software components.


## Compiling

Simply copy the source files to a directory of your choice. In addition
to the source, you will need the following required software packages:

* [Java JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 1.7.0 u51 or later
* [OpenKinect libfreenect](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started)

To build the project, switch to the root of the source directory, and
type:

    ./gradlew build

On Windows, switch to the root of the source directory, and type:

    gradlew.bat build

The compiled Jar file will be placed in the `build/libs` directory.


## Running

### Command Line Help

There are several options available for the program. Running the jar
with the `-h` option will display a helpful description of the options:

    java -jar build/libs/visualclassifier-0.1.jar -h


### Training the NeuralNetwork

The `train` sub-command allows you to train a neural network with a group
of images contained within a set of directories. The positive examples must
be contained in one directory, and the negative examples must be contained
within another. The images can be in any valid image format. They must all 
be the same width and height. For training, you must also split the dataset
into a training / testing fold. Assuming that images are 60 pixels by 60 pixels,
and you wish to use 80% of the data set for training, and 20% for testing:

    java -jar build/libs/visualclassifier-0.1.jar train -p /path/to/positives \
         -n /path/to/negatives -w 60 -h 60 -s 80

You can also set the learning rate with `-l`:

    java -jar build/libs/visualclassifier-0.1.jar train -p /path/to/positives \
         -n /path/to/negatives -w 60 -h 60 -s 80 -l 0.001

By default, the network trains for 500 iterations. You can change that with the
`-i` option:

    java -jar build/libs/visualclassifier-0.1.jar train -p /path/to/positives \
         -n /path/to/negatives -w 60 -h 60 -s 80 -i 1000

During training, you can have the network output periodic messages containing
the cost for that iteration. This is known as a heartbeat. The heartbeat will
display information after the specified number of iterations with the `-h`
option. To display after 100 iterations:

    java -jar build/libs/visualclassifier-0.1.jar train -p /path/to/positives \
         -n /path/to/negatives -w 60 -h 60 -s 80 -h 100

You can also use k-fold cross validation. You can specify the number of folds to
randomly be built from the dataset with the `-f` option. For example, to perform
10-fold cross validation:

    java -jar build/libs/visualclassifier-0.1.jar train -p /path/to/positives \
         -n /path/to/negatives -w 60 -h 60 -s 80 -f 10

You can specify the number of nodes (neurons) to use in each layer of the network,
up to a maximum of 2 hidden layers with `-l1` for layer 1, and `-l2` for layer 2.
For example, to create a network with a hidden layer containing 20 nodes:

    java -jar build/libs/visualclassifier-0.1.jar train -p /path/to/positives \
         -n /path/to/negatives -w 60 -h 60 -s 80 -l1 20

When making predictions, the network uses a threshold of 0.5. This means that 
values over 0.5 will be predicted as positive, and under 0.5 will be predicted
as negative. You can change the threshold with the `-t` option:

    java -jar build/libs/visualclassifier-0.1.jar train -p /path/to/positives \
         -n /path/to/negatives -w 60 -h 60 -s 80 -t 0.7

You can also save the false positive and false negative images to a sub-directory
with the `--save` option. The directory must exist, and must be writable. Images
will take on the name `fp` for False Positive, and `fn` for False Negative.
